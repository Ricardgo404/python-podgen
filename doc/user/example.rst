Below is a working example of how you can go about using PodcastGenerator. It
also shows you how you can use the different properties of Podcast and Episode.

.. literalinclude:: ../../feedgen/__main__.py
   :pyobject: main
   :linenos:

:doc:`/api` in conjunction with the :doc:`basic_usage_guide/index` to see exactly what properties you can set, and how they
affect the end result.
