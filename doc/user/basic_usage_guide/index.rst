Basic usage guide
=================

When using PodGen, you can divide your program into
three phases:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   part_1
   part_2
   part_3

While the
:doc:`../example` gives you a practical introduction, this document helps you
understand what the different attributes mean and how they should be used.
It complements the :doc:`/api` nicely.
