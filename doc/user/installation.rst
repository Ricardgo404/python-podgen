Installation
============

Use `pip <https://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_::

    $ pip install podgen

Just a word of warning: PodGen depends on
`lxml <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lxml>`_, which can take several minutes to build.

Remember to use a `virtual environment <http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/>`_!
